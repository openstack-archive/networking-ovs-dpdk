=====
Usage
=====
Follow the `Installation <installation.html>`_ document first.
This document describes how to use OVS-DPDK with devstack as well as configuration settings and values they accept.

To use networking-ovs-dpdk with devstack add the below to local.conf::

    enable_plugin networking-ovs-dpdk https://github.com/stackforge/networking-ovs-dpdk master


Note: Virtual Machines using vhost-user need to be backed by hugepages.
For correct operation of OpenVSwitch the total logical CPU count on the host should not exceed the number of queues available on the physical networking interfaces.
That's a limitation that should be fixed in newer versions of OVS.


Example::

    nova flavor-key m1.tiny set "hw:mem_page_size=large"


local.conf settings
-------------------
See :download:`local.conf_example <_downloads/local.conf_example>` for sample usage of the below settings.

Default values for the below settings can be found in `settings` file in devstack directory of the main OVS DPDK repository.

**OVS_INSTALL_DIR**
    (Filesystem path) Directory containing OVS compiled files are installed to.

**OVS_DB_CONF_DIR**
    (Filesystem path) Directory containing OVS configuration and database files.
    Default: /etc/openvswitch/

**OVS_DB_SOCKET_DIR**
    (Filesystem path) Directory to create socket of a running OVS in.

**OVS_DB_CONF**
    (Filesystem path) File path to OVS configuration database.

**OVS_DB_SOCKET**
    (Filesystem path) File path to OVS socket.

**OVS_SOCKET_MEM**
    (Size in MB/auto) Amount of memory reserved by OVS from each Numa node. 'auto' defaults to 2048MB per Numa node.
    Example:
    OVS_SOCKET_MEM=1024,0
    OVS_SOCKET_MEM=auto

**OVS_MEM_CHANNELS**
    (Number) Number of memory channels into the processor OVS will use.

**OVS_CORE_MASK**
    cpu core mask in hexa format, according to it's value CPU cores are selected.
    OVS_CORE_MASK is used for ovs-vswitchd process as -c option, it has default value 2.

    Example:
    OVS_CORE_MASK=3 (0x011 binary -> first two cores taken)

**OVS_PMD_CORE_MASK**
    the mask in hexa format for the PMD threads of ovs set in the db,
    OVS_PMD_CORE_MASK value is used for other_config:pmd-cpu-mask parameter in ovsdb.
    It has default value 4.

**OVS_LOG_DIR**
    (Filesystem path) Directory containing ovs-db and ovs-vswitchd log files.

**OVS_LOCK_DIR**
    (Filesystem path) Directory containing OVS lock file.

**OVS_SRC_DIR**
    (Filesystem path) Directory containing OVS source code. It's used along with RTE_SDK and RTE_TARGET to compile OVS DPDK.

**OVS_DIR**
    (Filesystem path) Destination installation directory for compiled OVS DPDK.

**OVS_UTILS**
    (Filesystem path) Destination installation directory for compiled OVS DPDK utilities.

**OVS_DB_UTILS**
    (Filesystem path) Directory containing OVS DB and related utilities.

**OVS_DPDK_DIR**
    (Filesystem path) Directory containing DPDK compiled libraries.

**OVS_ALLOCATE_HUGEPAGES**
    (True/False) Indicates whether to allocate hugepages for OVS. If 'True' OpenVSwitch/DPDK will allocate hugepages of the default size for currently running Operating System (i.e.: 2kB).

**OVS_DPDK_GIT_TAG**
    (git tag/branch/commitId) Indicates which tag, branch or commitId of DPDK source to checkout before compiling.

**OVS_NUM_HUGEPAGES**
    (Number) Amount of hugepages to mount if OVS_ALLOCATE_HUGEPAGES is True.

**OVS_DPDK_VHOST_USER_DEBUG**
    (True/False) Indicates whether to enable debugging for VHOST USER in DPDK.

**OVS_HUGEPAGE_MOUNT**
    (Filesystem path) Mount point to use for hugepages. It's created and hugepages mounted if doesn't exist on the filesystem.

**OVS_HUGEPAGE_MOUNT_PAGESIZE**
    (2M/1G) Preferred hugepage size. Defaults to Operating System's default if not set. If '1G' value is used hugepages should be allocated before starting ovs (i.e.: at kernel boot command line).

**OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS**
    (network:bridge) List of comma separated pairs of "physical network:bridge name" used by DPDK/OVS.
    Example:
    OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS=default:br-eth1,default1:br-enp9s0f0

**OVS_DPDK_PORT_MAPPINGS**
    (nic:bridge) List of comma separated pairs of "nic:bridge name" used by DPDK/OVS.
    "nic" must be a NIC interface present in the system; "bridge" is the linux virtual bridge created by OVS.
    Example:
    OVS_DPDK_PORT_MAPPINGS=eth1:br-01,eth2:br-01,eth3:br-02

**OVS_INTERFACE_DRIVER**
    (vfio-pci/igb_uio) NIC driver to use for physical network interface(s). Note: drivers names are the ones supported by DPDK, i.e.: not the kernel names.

**OVS_AGENT_TYPE**
    (openvswitch/dpdk/...) Name of the Q_AGENT to use. Defaults to 'ovsdpdk' if not set.

**OVS_PATCHES**
    (http/ftp/file location) Space separated cURL-like locations of OVS patches. Patches are downloaded and applied in the same order they are listed here.

**OVS_DATAPATH_TYPE**
    (datapath type) OVS bridges will be set to use this datapath. This parameter should be set to 'netdev' (without '') for userspace OVS.

**OVS_DPDK_RTE_LIBRTE_VHOST**
    (y/n) Enable libvhost/vhost-cuse. If ovs commit is before vhost-cuse support was added, this should be 'n'. Defaults to 'y'.

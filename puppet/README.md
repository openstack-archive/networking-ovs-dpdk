Overview
--------

The ovsdpdk module is responsible for installation of openvswitch with DPDK support.
As of now we are not providing package distributions, therefore we can't remove vanilla ovs 
mainly due to package dependencies. Current procedure is to replace vanilla ovs binaries with 
dpdk tuned binaries and patch ovs in use.


Installation
------------

#### Installing ovsdpdk puppet module

        Step1) Get freshly installed OS from supported platforms below

        Step2) Openstack installation based on puppet modules
        We are using puppet-openstack-integration for the same, instructions are under following link:
        https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Puppet/Deploy

        Original system/kernel based ovs configuration will be replaced during ovs-dpdk init.
        So it's recommended to perform ovsdpdk installation on freshly installed openstack w/o any VM running.

        Step3) Customize ovsdpdk parameters based on your environment
        Parameters for DPDK build are described in ./ovsdpdk/manifests/init.pp
        Environment variables are in ./ovsdpdk/manifests/param.pp and not expected to be changed frequently
        One of installation examples with very low RAM usage intended for small VMs is in ./examples/install_small.pp
        Instructions how to use it are in this file, but you will most likely need to customize it differently.

#### Preconditions

        1. It's usefull to check whether openstack is in good shape before ovsdpdk deployment
        (e.g. check if all agents and services are running via system info in openstack dashboard)

        2. It was well tested on freshly installed openstack, previously spawned VM's or networks may have
        some issue to run in new ovs-dpdk environment.

    During the Newton cycle support for deploying ovs-dpdk was added
    to the puppet-vswitch project. With the release of the Newton branch
    puppet support in networking-ovs-dpdk was deprecated. In the ocata
    cycle support for deploying ovs-dpdk from source via puppet has been
    removed from newton.
